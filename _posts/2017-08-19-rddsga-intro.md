title: "Subgroup analysis in RDD settings"

![](/files/rd-plot.png)

I've been relatively quiet lately, but that doesn't mean I'm not busy. *Au contraire*, as I'm working on many new projects (and work from the overlords has intensified). One such projects is **`rddsga`, a new Stata command to conduct subgroup analysis in RD settings.**

More information on subgroup analysis, program installation and a Stata application can be found on the [project's repository](https://github.com/acarril/rddsga).
