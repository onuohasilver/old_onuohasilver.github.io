From microeconomic theory we know that
$$S(p, w) \cdot p = 0,$$
where $$S$$ is the Slutsky matrix and $$p$$ is the price vector.

Why?

It is a general mathematical result that the [Hessian matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hessian_matrix) of a multivariate function is homogeneous of degree one.

But really, *why*?

We know that the **expenditure function** $$E$$  is homogeneous of degree one in prices. Intuitively, if all prices change in the same proportion then relative prices stay constant. And if relative prices stay constant, the minimum-cost compensated bundle for a given utility level also remains unchanged. That is, budget shares stay the same. So the *expenditure* (expressed by $$E$$)  needed to achieve the same utility level as before changes in the same proportion as prices, and so we have homogeneity of degree one.

By duality, the **Hicksian demand** vector is the gradient of the expenditure function on prices,

$$H= \frac{d E}{d p}.$$

Intuitively, $$H$$ gives the minimum-cost demanded quantities. Due to the homogeneity of degree one of the expenditure function, the inner product of the Hicksian demand vector times the price vector equals the expenditure function:

$$H\cdot p=E.$$

This is because we are just multiplying the (minimum-cost) demanded quantities by their unit price and then summing up, which is total expenditure.

Combining these two results we have that

$$\frac{d (H\cdot p)}{dp}=H$$

$$H + \frac{d H}{dp}\cdot p = H.$$

So it follows that when $$H=0$$,

$$\frac{dH}{dp}\cdot p = 0.$$

We know that the [Jacobian matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant) of the Hicksian demand is the Hessian matrix of the expenditure function, that is,

$$\frac{dH}{dp}=\frac{d^2E}{dp^2}=S(p,w).$$

So using these last two results gives us that

$$S(p, w) \cdot p = 0.$$

This means that compensated demanded quantities are not affected by changes in price if relative prices remain constant.
