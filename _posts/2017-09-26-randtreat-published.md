Today I got my very first ever singleâ€“handedly-written article [published in the Stata Journal](http://www.stata-journal.com/article.html?article=st0490)! The PDF can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/os7f4zohdtt2zap/sjart_st0490.pdf?dl=0).

A good introduction to the issue addressed in the article (the *misfits* problem) can be found in Bruhn and McKenzie's [original blog post](http://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/tools-of-the-trade-doing-stratified-randomization-with-uneven-numbers-in-some-strata). Some time ago I wrote `randtreat`, a Stata program that provides tools to deal with misfits. Be sure to check out the [help file](https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s458106.html) for more details on the program.
