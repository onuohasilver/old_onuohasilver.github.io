There has never been a better time in the history of mankind to be a scientist.
Vast amounts of data and tools to further advance scientific research are widely available to the population, and these tools are getting both more sophisticated and less expensive at a breakneck pace.
Even though [some powerful people are trying hard to make alternative facts great again](https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/23/15682188/trump-science-budget-nih-cdc-nsf-epa-doe-energy-research-funding-cuts), other [world leaders have responded boldly](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-election-macron-idUSKBN15J0RQ).
Notwithstanding these hiccups, today science and technology reign supreme.

The age we're currently living in is usually dubbed "the information age" or "digital age", with good reason. Since the digital revolution we've been capitalizing on computer miniaturization advances, and this has led to the fact that the modernization of information and communication processes has become the driving force of social evolution. This certainly includes science, and in fact it could be argued that science is one of the human endeavors most inextricably intertwined with the digital age.
Science, after all, is what started the digital revolution.

However, I believe the hallmark of scientific research from this age onwards will not be merely computers, "big data" or algorithms. Those tools are certainly important (and I'm a huge fan, as you can probably guess if you're here), and extremely innovative work is being done in this regard. However, *I believe the hallmark of this age's scientific research will be collaboration, and the single biggest hinder for scientific collaboration today is the scientific paper paywall.*

## The collaborative scientist

The image of a lone genius working like a madman is what people tend to associate with a scientist. Individuals like [Grigori Perelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Perelman) confirm this stereotype, and I think they will never disappear. I don't think they should, as many gifted people are known to thrive in isolation. However, that is not the only path to new discoveries.

Nowadays, however, an increasing number of scientific advancements are being carried out by many people working together. On a small scale, mathematician [Terry Tao has made collaboration a hallmark of his career](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/07/26/magazine/the-singular-mind-of-terry-tao.html?module=Promotron&region=Body&action=click&pgtype=article&referer). This collaboration is more than just co-authoring, as he actively [participates on the Math Overflow community](https://mathoverflow.net/users/766/terry-tao) and maintains a [fairly popular blog](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/). OK, very popular... I'm just envious.

[Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) is a professor of statistics, core developer of many [R language](https://www.r-project.org/) extensions and chief scientist at [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), a very popular IDE for R.
His book "R for Data Science" condenses many modern advances to the R language, most of which he has developed himself. [His book was developed in the open](https://github.com/hadley/r4ds) and is open source, so people all around the world can access it, comment and refine the material. He uses the same approach for all his R packages, hosted in [his Github page](https://github.com/hadley), and also [participates actively on the Stack Overflow programming community](https://stackoverflow.com/users/16632/hadley).

I admire both of these scientists for many reasons, chief of which is their open, modern approach to doing science. They are example of what I think a modern scientist should do, and it is my belief that this "collaborative scientist" model will become increasingly more successful.

## The paywall

A scientist's job is literally to bring new knowledge into the world.
Information is the scientists' currency, and it is by sharing the information you collect, connect or discover that you collaborate with the scientific community. Thus, the simplest way to stand in the way of collaboration is to *share as little as possible*, which is exactly what paywalled journals accomplish. I think [Mike Taylor's article](https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2013/jan/17/open-access-publishing-science-paywall-immoral) in the Washington Post sums it up strongly:

> Dammit, we're scientists. Our job is to make knowledge. If we make it, then brick it up behind a wall, we're wasting our time and our funders' money â€“ which ultimately means we're squandering the world's wealth.

> Publishing behind paywalls is immoral. More than that, it's oxymoronic: if it's behind a paywall, it hasn't been published. We have to stop doing it, now and for always.

For me, the paywalled-paper model embodies everything that collaborative science is not. I think it hinders scientific advancement, and for that reason I also think it will disappear soon. Thankfully I'm not the only one who believes that.

## Jumping over the paywall

I'm all about [Open Access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access), which basically advocates for free, immediate, online availability of research articles with full re-use rights, available to everyone all over the world.
[PHD Comics](http://phdcomics.com/) has an excellent video explanation of what Open Access is all about:

I believe Open Access is the future of publishing, but the question remains how long should we wait to get there. If you found your way into my humble webpage and read this article, chances are you are simple RA, just like myself. In that case my friend, let me introduce you to arguably the single best tool of the RA toolkit (OK, I exaggerated... but it's pretty damn useful).

### Sci-Hub

[Alexandra Elbakyan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_Elbakyan) is a Kazakhstani graduate student, computer programmer and creator of Sci-Hub, a website that bypasses journal paywalls, illegally providing access to nearly every scientific paper ever published to anyone. You'd be right if you thought that Sci-Hub has proven to be highly controversial, lauded by parts of the scientific and academic communities and condemned by a number of publishers.

The way it works is extremely ingenious. First, it attempts to download a copy of the requested paper from the LibGen database of pirated content. LibGen started hosting academic papers in 2012 and now contains over 50 million papers. If the requested paper is not on LibGen, Sci-Hub bypasses the journals' paywall in real time by using access keys donated by academics who study or teach at institutions who have paid access. So you're routed straight to the paper in a matter of seconds, bypassing logins in JSTOR, Springer, Sage, and Elsevier, among many others. After delivering the paper, Sci-Hub stores it to the growing LibGen library, where it will be stored for further requests.

This is smart, because as the number of papers in the LibGen database increases, the frequency with which Sci-Hub has to use its coveted access keys decreases, which minimizes the risk of triggering the publishers' alarm bells.

So where can you find these wonderful sites?

You probably noticed I didn't link any mention of Sci-Hub or LibGen. That's on purpose, because they have to change address often. You can always Google it, but right now these links work:

- [http://sci-hub.io/]()
- [http://libgen.io/]() (it has tons of books, too)

Happy researching!
