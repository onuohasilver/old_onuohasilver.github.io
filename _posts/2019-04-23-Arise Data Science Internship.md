## 6 Week Internship

The **Paylater** *(now carbon)* arise data science internship has come and gone but the exposure and knowledge I gained through it has come to stay. There was a tweet by the **paylater** handle calling for applications into their data science internship program, a program designed to help young Nigerians who have the desire to get in to the data science field. I quickly applied and within a week or so I got a mail that I’d been accepted into the program. Every day spent reading and working on the challenges was awe-inspiring ; I was exposed to tools that I was conversant with before the program, tools like *bigquery*, *superquery* and the rest of them. The program design made it possible for me to work through the data science pipeline from data wrangling, through data cleaning and visualization and also to model building and evaluation, unfortunately we never quite go to the model implementation aspect which I hope I get to do sometime in the near future.

*“If you have any questions I will be happy to answer them, just send me a mail’* that was the classic Devon Stone. Devon was our handler during the program and he was really good at it, calmly entertaining all our questions – even the offbeat ones too. He made it all sound fun and simple, and the other guys too- my fellow interns, they were all amazing- I mean how can a bunch of guys be that cool? Always ready to answer the questions posed and all that stuff. Cracking jokes to quell the tension of learning as we went along.

During the course of the program we were required to perform some basic data analysis on some datasets provided us and also to build some predictive models for loan default.

The final project was quite challenging- well to say the truth it was termed the final challenge- so it goes without saying. We were required to build a loan predeliquency model, but first we had to use google bigquery to extract the data we needed from the database file, then we had to use superquery to download it as a comma separated value file (.csv). writing the query took me quite sometime because of the different steps of conditions you had to encode into the query but once I was done, I got the downloaded dataset up to colab *(colab is an online interactive coding platform with free GPU support offered by google to aid data scientists with faster compute power).*

After data exploration, handling missing values and the rest, I visualized the data and then built a Random Forest Model on the dataset.

The Random Forest Model performed quite well when compared to the Multi Layer Perceptron counterpart which was used as a comparative model. 

I submitted my notebook at about 11:40pm with just about twenty minutes left on the clock to closure. 
Don’t guess the score --- I will tell you.



I scored a perfect (10/10).

Devon pointed out a few places where I could have even performed better, hopefully I will get more opportunities to work out the kinks. 

During the final challenge I found out that my major weakness currently borders around querying databases and off I go to edx to learn more on querying languages.

I came out better than I was when I got into the program.  Isn’t that the goal of everyone?
It was a fun experience for me! 


## Thanks Carbon!
