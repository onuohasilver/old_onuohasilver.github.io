Whenever we do regression analysis there is the chance of getting false positives. Suppose you have $$k$$ outcome variables and are targeting a $$p$$-value of $$p$$. Is there a way to compute *ex ante* the exact probability of getting at least one false positive significant result under $$p$$?

This question arose during a discussion with a J-PAL colleague. Since we were talking about randomized control trials, he also considered a treatment group of size $$m$$ and a control group of size $$n$$.

But does it matter?

Assuming i.i.d. Normal characteristics we can use separate [Welch's $$t$$-tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welch%27s_t_test), which account for different variances and sample sizes. If the statistics of these tests are $$w_i$$ ($$i=1,..., k$$), the $$p$$-value of each one is

$$ p_i = \Pr(|w_i|\geq w(\alpha)\mid H_0),$$

where $$H_0$$ is the null hypothesis<!--- of equal means of the control and treatment groups-->.

The above probability can be expressed in terms of the corresponding cumulative distribution function, that is, $$\Pr (\cdot)=1-F( \mid w_i \mid )$$ . Therefore we have that

$$F(|w_i|)=1-p_i .$$

The key here is thinking of $$p$$-values as random variables and, because of the magic of [probability integral transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_integral_transform), we know that $$(1-p_i)$$ distributes uniformly, so we get

$$ p_i\sim U(0,1).$$

Now we have a sample size of $$k$$ independent uniform distributions. The probability that at least one of them is smaller than a specific value $$\overline p$$ is equal to the probability that the minimum of them is lower than that threshold, that is,

$$ \Pr(\text{At least one }p_i \leq \overline p) = 1- \Pr (\text{All }p_i > \overline p ) = 1- \prod_{i=1}^k \Pr (p_i > p^*).$$

Since all $$p_i$$ are identically distributed, we have that

$$ \Pr(\text{At least one }p_i \leq \overline p) = 1-[1-\Pr(p_i\leq\overline p)]^k = 1-[1-F_U(\overline p)]^k,$$

which is the [cumulative distribution function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function) (CDF) of the minimum of $$k$$ i.i.d. random variables.

Let's say this minimum is $$p_{min}$$, then the CDF of the minimum of $$k$$ independent $$U(0,1)$$ variables is

$$ F_{p_{min}}(p_{min}) = 1- [1-p_{min}]^k.$$

Therefore we want to know the probability

$$ \Pr (p_{min}\leq \overline p) = 1-[1-p_{min}]^k. $$

So it is interesting to note that the probability of getting at least one false positive significant result under $$p$$ doesn't depend on the size of treatment nor control groups (in an impact evaluation setting), or even on sample size. Because $$p$$-values are random variables, they are uniformly distributed $$(0,1)$$ regardless of sample size.\*

To get an idea of some typical values of our last formula, here is a table:

$$
\begin{array}{rr|lllll}
  &    &       &       & p     &       &       \\
  &    & 0.001 & 0.005 & 0.01  & 0.05  & 0.1   \\\hline
  & 1  & 0.001 & 0.005 & 0.010 & 0.050 & 0.100 \\
  & 2  & 0.002 & 0.010 & 0.020 & 0.098 & 0.190 \\
  & 3  & 0.003 & 0.015 & 0.030 & 0.143 & 0.271 \\
  & 4  & 0.004 & 0.020 & 0.039 & 0.185 & 0.344 \\
  & 5  & 0.005 & 0.025 & 0.049 & 0.226 & 0.410 \\
k & 10 & 0.010 & 0.049 & 0.096 & 0.401 & 0.651 \\
  & 15 & 0.015 & 0.072 & 0.140 & 0.537 & 0.794 \\
  & 20 & 0.020 & 0.095 & 0.182 & 0.642 & 0.878 \\
  & 30 & 0.030 & 0.140 & 0.260 & 0.785 & 0.958 \\
  & 40 & 0.039 & 0.182 & 0.331 & 0.871 & 0.985 \\
  & 50 & 0.049 & 0.222 & 0.395 & 0.923 & 0.995
\end{array}
$$

\* Of course, the values of $$m$$ and $$n$$ do enter the test-statistic. For example, if we assume that the underlying data is normally distributed i.i.d., with mean $$\mu$$ and variance $$\sigma$$ for both treatment and control groups, then it can be proven we can get the [Student's $$t$$-statistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test):

$$t = \frac{\overline {X}_1 - \overline{X}_2}{s_{X_1 X_2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{m}+\frac{1}{n}}},$$

where

$$s_{X_1X_2} = \sqrt{\frac{(m-1)s_{X_1}^2+(n-1)s_{X_2}^2}{m+n}}.$$
