I'm a graduate engineer from the Computer Engineering department of [Michael Okpara University of Agriculture](http://mouauportal.edu.ng).
My research interests include development of machine learning models which have the ability to handle imbalanced datasets using various novel techniques with a focus on the finance and health data sector. I have developed several  [Python routines](/resources), all of which are available in my [Git repo](http://www.github.com/onuohasilver). I am also a member of [Data Science Nigeria](http://datasciencenigeria.org).
My programming languages of choice would be Python and R.

You can find my CV [here](/cv).
I've collected much of my work in the [research](/research) and [resources](/resources) sections of this website.
Feel free to write me at [onuohasilver9@gmail.com](mailto:onuohasilver9@gmail.com).

# About this site

I like it when researchers take the time to share their knowledge of the computational tools that they use, so the [blog](/) section of this website is an attempt to do so myself.
Over the years I've accumulated some expertise on what I call "the tools of the trade", and I find it both constructive and fun to write blog posts covering specific topics.
I hope you find something useful.
