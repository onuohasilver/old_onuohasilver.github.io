Okay So what do I say?? 

I'm a budding data scientist who excels at machine learning, exploratory analysis, and data visualizations.
I am deeply fascinated by the ability of machines to learn and do stuff that we previously believed that only
humans could achieve. 
It's quite beautiful to learn about this things, and ever since I discovered this branch of computing I have 
become dedicated to improving my understanding of the field and honing my data handling skills.
